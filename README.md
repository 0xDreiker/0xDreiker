### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></a>

My name is Juan Manuel, I'm from Spain, and this is my Github.

I started programming at a very young age through videogames and studied for [Higher Technician in Web Development](https://www.todofp.es/dam/jcr:7c3d42db-83bf-4abb-9d81-cd4f41fe1a1a/n-tsdesarrolloaplicacionesweben-pdf.pdf)

- ðŸŽ® At 15 years I became a staff member (game master) of a successful World of Warcraft server through passion & technical skill.
- ðŸ›  I'm one of the developers of [Blasphemous](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/828401966/blasphemous-dark-and-brutal-2d-non-linear-platform) campaign worth $333.246. [Blasphemous](https://store.steampowered.com/app/774361/Blasphemous/) is the most exigent project I've prototyped and developed from the ground up using Unity Engine.
- ðŸŽž My favorite movies are Fight Club and Braveheart.
